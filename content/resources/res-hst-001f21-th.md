description: Ampli construction sets are modular blocks designed to contain paper-based
  fluidic elements, that can be connected together to form paperfluidic circuits.
  This makes it possible to quickly and easily engineer paper analytical devices for
  glucose assays, infection diagnostics, and many other uses.(Image by Little Devices
